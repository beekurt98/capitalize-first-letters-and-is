You can enter a full lowercase text and this program will capitalize first letters of each sentence and the lowercase "i" pronouns. 

It works with double quotes. If the text in double quotes ends with a comma (,) then the program will not capitalize it, but if it's a period (.) then it will turn it into uppercase.


An example lowercase nonsense text if you'd like to try: 

"hey," he said to his friend. "how's it going? i haven't seen you in a while."

"it has been a long time, my friend, hasn't it." his friend approached his car. it was red and looked new.
